**Storage Location:** Browser localStorage  
**Retention:** Until you clear browser data or reset project  
**Access:** Only you (stored locally on your device)

### Data Sent to Google's Gemini AI

When you use AI features, we send **only** the following data to Google's Gemini API:

#### ✅ What We DO Send

1. **Project Descriptions** (sanitized)
   - Your project description text

   - Selected design style (e.g., "minimalist")
   - Selected color theme (e.g., "ocean-breeze")
   - Selected components (e.g., "carousel", "accordion")
   - Selected animations (e.g., "fade-in")

3. **Generated Prompts** (technical content only)

## Data Sanitization

Before sending any data to AI, we automatically remove personal information:

### Automatic Removal

```typescript
// Email addresses
"Contact me at john@example.com" → "Contact me at [email]"

// Phone numbers
"Call me at 555-123-4567" → "Call me at [phone]"

```

### What This Means

Even if you accidentally include personal information in your project description, it will be automatically removed before being sent to AI.
