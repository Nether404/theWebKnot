- Use **Smart Defaults** for intelligent suggestions
- Check **AI Suggestions** panel for compatible options
- Look at the **Harmony Score** to ensure choices work together
- Read option descriptions for guidance

### What's the difference between Detailed and Basic prompts?

---

## 🤖 AI Features

### What is Smart Defaults?
Smart Defaults automatically pre-selects options based on your project type. For example, choosing "Portfolio" suggests Minimalist style, clean layouts, and appropriate components.

### How accurate is the Prompt Quality Score?
Very accurate! It analyzes your prompt for completeness, best practices, and potential issues. Aim for 85+ for excellent results.

### What does the Harmony Score mean?
The Harmony Score (0-100) shows how well your design choices work together:
- **90-100**: Excellent harmony
- **75-89**: Good combination
- **60-74**: Minor issues
- **Below 60**: Consider adjustments

### Should I fix all warnings?
- **Red warnings**: Yes, fix these (important issues)
- **Yellow tips**: Recommended but optional
- **Green checks**: You're doing great!

### How does Natural Language Input work?
Just describe your project naturally (e.g., "I want a minimalist portfolio with blue colors") and WebKnot detects:
- Project type
- Design style
- Color preferences
- And more!

### What are Context-Aware Suggestions?
AI recommendations that appear based on your selections. For example, choosing Glassmorphism style triggers suggestions for compatible colors and components.

---

## 🎨 Design Choices

### How many components should I choose?
Start with 3-5 essential components. Minimalist designs work best with fewer components (5-7), while complex sites can have more (8-12).

### Can I use my own brand colors?
Yes! Select "Custom" in the color theme step and enter your specific colors.

### What if I don't have brand colors?
Use one of our preset themes - they're professionally designed to work well together.

### Which design style should I choose?
- **Portfolio/Creative**: Minimalist or Glassmorphism
- **Business/Corporate**: Modern Corporate
- **E-commerce**: Material Design
- **Tech/Startup**: Glassmorphism or Futuristic
- **Bold/Edgy**: Digital Brutalism

### How many animations should I add?
Less is more! Choose 2-3 subtle animations. Too many can be distracting and slow down your site.

---

## 🔧 React-Bits Components

### What are React-Bits components?
Professional, pre-built UI components you can add to your website. Think of them as building blocks - carousels, cards, timelines, animations, etc.

### How many React-Bits components are available?
93 components across three categories:
- 31 Backgrounds
- 37 UI Components
- 25 Animations

### Do I need to install React-Bits separately?
No! The generated prompt includes installation commands. The AI tool will handle installation when building your site.

### Can I search for specific components?
Yes! Use the search box on Background, Components, and Animations steps. You can also filter by tags.

### What if I can't find a component?
Try different keywords or browse by category. If you still can't find it, it might not be available yet.

---

## 🤖 Google Gemini AI

### What is Google Gemini AI?
WebKnot uses Google's Gemini 2.5 AI to provide intelligent assistance throughout your design process. It analyzes your project and suggests optimal choices.

### Do I need to pay for AI features?
No! AI features are free for all users with a rate limit of 20 requests per hour.

### What is the AI rate limit?
Free users get 20 AI requests per hour. This includes:
- Project analysis
- Smart defaults
- Design suggestions
- Prompt enhancement

### What happens if I hit the rate limit?
You'll see a message showing when you can use AI again (usually within an hour). The app continues working with standard analysis in the meantime.

### Is my data private when using AI?
Yes! Your data is:
- Anonymized before being sent to Google
- Never stored on our servers
- Only used for analysis
- Protected by Google's privacy policies

### Do I need to give consent for AI features?
Yes. The first time you use AI features, you'll see a consent dialog explaining how your data is used. You can disable AI anytime in settings.

### What if AI features aren't working?
Common solutions:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Ensure AI is enabled in settings
3. Verify you've given consent
4. Wait if you've hit the rate limit
5. Refresh the page

### Why did I get a "Request Timeout" error?
This means the AI took too long to respond (usually due to network issues). The app automatically switches to standard analysis. Try again in a moment.

### Can I disable AI features?
Yes! Go to Settings and toggle "Enable AI Features" off. The app works perfectly without AI using rule-based analysis.

### How fast are AI features?
- Smart Defaults: < 50ms (instant)
- Project Analysis: 3-5 seconds
- Prompt Enhancement: 6-8 seconds
- Most requests are cached for instant results

### What's the difference between AI and standard analysis?
- **AI Analysis**: Uses Google Gemini for intelligent, context-aware suggestions (85%+ confidence)
- **Standard Analysis**: Uses rule-based algorithms (60-70% confidence)

Both work well, but AI provides more accurate and personalized recommendations.
